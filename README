Script to encode video files with the H.256 (HEVC) codec.

I prefer the .mp4 container so it's hardcoded to output the file to .mp4

Files are output to ./hevc directory in the current directory.

Run from the command line with either a single directory or a single filename

If a directory is supplied, all video files in the directory will be converted
